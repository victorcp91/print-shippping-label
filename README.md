# ðŸ“¦ USPS Shipping Label Generator â€“ EasyPost API Prototype

This project is a **functional prototype** developed as part of a technical test for a Frontend Software Engineer position.  
The goal is to build a simple web application using **Next.js 14+, React, and TypeScript** that allows the user to **generate and print USPS (United States Postal Service) shipping labels** through the **EasyPost API**.

## ðŸš€ Application Flow

1. **Shipment Form** â€“ Enter sender and recipient information (**US addresses only**) and package details (weight in ounces, dimensions in inches).
2. **Rate Selection** â€“ Fetch and display available USPS shipping rates, allowing the user to choose one.
3. **Label Preview & Print** â€“ Show the generated shipping label with options to print or download.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
